Syntax Highlighting based on [atom-kotlin-language](https://github.com/alexmt/atom-kotlin-language) by [Alexander Matyushentsev](https://github.com/alexmt) converted from [Sublime Text package](https://github.com/vkostyukov/kotlin-sublime-package) which has been implemented by [Vladimir Kostyukov](https://github.com/vkostyukov).
